media-player-id is a repository of data files describing media player
(mostly USB Mass Storage ones) capabilities. These files contain information
about the directory layout to use to add music to these devices, about the
supported file formats, ... These capabilities used to be provided by HAL but
had to be moved elsewhere as part of the big HALectomy.

The music player capabilities are now described in .mpi files (which are 
.ini-like files) which you can find in media-players/. These mpi files are
used to generate an udev rule to identify these devices. This rule associate
an ID_MEDIA_PLAYER attribute to the media player devices which specifies the
name of the .mpi file to use to find out the device capabilities. The .mpi 
can then be looked up in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/media-player-id (see the XDG Base
Directory Specification for more information about what this means).
